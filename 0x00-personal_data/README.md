Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
How to encrypt a password and check the validity of an input password
How to authenticate to a database using environment variables
Requirements
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
All your functions should be type annotated
